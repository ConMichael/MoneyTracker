# Money Tracker

Application for Tracking Daily Money Usage in hope of helping me save money, made with Flutter.

## Basic Overview
The Basic Idea is that you are able to decide how much you want to be using everyday on average, and the app will let you keep track of how much you've spent/saved daily and monthly.

### Submit Spending

The screen to submit your spending is always the first screen to show so that you can quickly submit the amount you've just spent and continue with your day.

### Show your Savings

You'll be able to see how much you have left for the day, as well as how much you've saved so far in the monthly cycle. At the end of every day, the value in "Remaining Today" will be accumulated to the monthly savings.

### Settings

As of v0.1.0, the setting lets you change the daily limit and Reset the monthly saving which will also change the monthly cycle start date to today, and clear out every value.
