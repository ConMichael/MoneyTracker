Application for Tracking Daily Money Usage in hope of helping me save money, made with Flutter.
[Available in Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kahluabear.money_tracker&ah=Q-xAfI_2q4fv8B5SXuzCaEp0gTk)
## Basic Overview
The Basic Idea is that you are able to decide how much you want to be using everyday on average, and the app will let you keep track of how much you've spent/saved daily and monthly.

### Submit Spending

The screen to submit your spending is always the first screen to show so that you can quickly submit the amount you've just spent and continue with your day. The description box is optional, and you odn't have to enter it at the moment. You'll have an option to edit it later in the day.

### Show your Savings

You'll be able to see how much you have left for the day, as well as how much you've saved so far. At the end of every day, the value in "Remaining Today" will be accumulated to the Total savings.

### Daily Spendings

This screen shows you all the spendings you've made today, and lets you edit/delete the entries. 

### Settings

As of v0.5.0, the setting lets you change the daily limit and and allow you to change the System UI such as the adding or removing the save button next to the spend button, or change the way the history is displayed. A way to Clear out the Savings should be added some time.. but not important for now!
