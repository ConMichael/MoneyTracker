# Money Tracker

Application for Tracking Daily Money Usage, made with Flutter.

The Basic Idea is that you are able to decide how much you want to be using everyday on Average, and the app will let you keep track of how much you've spent/saved daily and monthly.


## Todo

- Proper Documentation with screenshots

- Add recurring payments (Subscriptions)
- Swipe between screens?
- Make Save Settings do the same as going back when there are no changes.
- Add Databases of all spendings
  - Maybe add a new screen that shows all the money spendings made
  - optional textfield if user wants to note what the spending was for

- The Spend Screen looks pretty empty (Study UI a bit more)
- Add features to the Display Screen
  - Once database is ready, maybe show graph of past week?
